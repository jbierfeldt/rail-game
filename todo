- finish implementation of scoring for factories, mines, and houses

- allow tile to be placed back in the dock to allow for scrolling
- reimplement board scrolling restrictions
- cause dropzone validation code to run initially... refactoring and DRY considering involved...
- change it so that ties result in neither player getting a bonus? Calculating the bonus doesn't really do anything to change the score differential in a two-player game. (oh but it does for a 2+ person game, so that two players can team up against a clear winner... think more about this.)
- should there be some kind of way to prevent 4-tile intersections?
